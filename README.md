# Background

Digitization has penetrated into the world of banking, forcing all banking companies to advance their technology. There are still many customers who complain about their digital banking who have to come to the teller or customer service at the nearest bank branch, it is very inefficient to find solutions to complaints and complaints from customers. We are here to provide a solution by creating an artificial intelligence Robot Message with Machine Learning, which will provide the right solution and make it easier for customers to interact with our banking company and solve problems for the solutions we provide from our Robot Message, which is named Chass (Complaint Handler Assistant).
