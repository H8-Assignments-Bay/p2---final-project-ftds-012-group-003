## Background

Digitization has penetrated into the world of banking, forcing all banking companies to advance their technology. There are still many customers who complain about their digital banking who have to come to the teller or customer service at the nearest bank branch, it is very inefficient to find solutions to complaints and complaints from customers. We are here to provide a solution by creating an artificial intelligence Robot Message with Machine Learning, which will provide the right solution and make it easier for customers to interact with our banking company and solve problems for the solutions we provide from our Robot Message, which is named Chass (Complaint Handler Assistant).

## How do I work?

If you know here i am Chass I'm a chatbot, I was created to help hacktiv banks to ease their burden on various complaints that come in for our company on the Twitter platform, which has an impact on the image of this company, and also take an intense approach to our customers by serving them fully to help solve their problem as follows:
1. Chass can detect the tweets of our customers complaints from the **Deep Learning Long Short-Term Memory** model  <img width=30 alt=icons8-tensorflow-48 src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103250002/182363125-06fcc93f-5b34-4fee-82a2-da8acd57517f.png>, then immediately reply to their tweets one by one without having to think what to caption.
2. Then Chass wants to chat with those who complain more closely so that they are satisfied with the service from my beloved company, namely hacktiv bank via <img width=30 alt=icons8-twitter src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103250002/182362503-58a1a5ff-5202-4cd2-b73c-8060b08ef186.gif>
 direct message.
3. Then this Chass is made from the **Multinomial Naive Bayes Machine Learning** model <img width=30 alt=scikitlearn src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103250002/182362975-499612fa-6c55-4e2a-869b-e1046a073edd.svg> so that it can interact with hacktiv bank customers by 2 great people, graduates from Bootcamp Fulltime Data Science Hactiv8.
4. After that, we chatted intensely so that we got solutions to the problems they were facing and eased the burden of time for customers who had to visit the teller or customer service bank.
